	<h1>Ya ok sure bud, but what even is this?</h1>

	<p>
		Ah yes. I thought you'd ask. Long story short, this is the best way I could think to describe
		the type of work I do. It's a portfolio, an art showcase, an art piece itself, and also just a
		wonky excuse to play with perlin noise fields. So that actually makes this page recursive!
	</p>

	<p>
		This web app is built using SvelteKit, Typescript, TailwindCSS, FontAwesome, and most
		importantly, NoiseJS. blah blah blah, describe the project and process, link to tyler's article,
		etc.
