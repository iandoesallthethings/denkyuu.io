I am a mercenary saxophonist for hire in the studio and on the stage as well as a co-founder and multi-instrumentalist of [Partials](https://partialsband.com), a band that creates worlds out of sound.

If you like the noises I make, please [get in touch](#contact) for sessions, sit-ins, collaborations, show-sharing, or even just to say hi! And don't forget to check out all the people I've collaborated with already. I'm just saying... I have cool friends.
